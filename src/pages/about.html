                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I am a 20-year-old currently in my second year of pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software
                    Engineering at Canadian
                    Institute of Technolog. While I am still a student, I have gained practical experience through
                    self-initiated projects
                    in the field of programming. This hands-on work has allowed me to become proficient in a range of
                    programming languages
                    and develop problem-solving skills. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am fluent in multiple
                    languages, including
                    Albanian and English, and I have a basic understanding of Turkish.</p>
                <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a range of hobbies and interests that bring joy to my life. I
                    have a strong
                    passion for creative arts, particularly drawing, acting, and dancing. These artistic outlets allow
                    me to express myself
                    and explore my creative side. Moreover, I find great happiness in spending quality time with my
                    family and friends, as
                    they are an essential part of my life. I am a dedicated animal lover. Additionally, I have a keen
                    interest in social media
                    and enjoy delving into the world of marketing through these platforms. My varied interests help me
                    maintain a balanced
                    and fulfilling life outside of my professional endeavors."</p>
                <h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>
                <p>In the upcoming years, I aspire to achieve a harmonious balance between personal and professional
                    growth. On a
                    professional front, my goal is to continually strive for success, broadening my skills, and making a
                    meaningful impact
                    in my field.Simultaneously, I am committed to enhancing my well-being, focusing on maintaining good
                    health and finding
                    happiness in both small moments and significant milestones.</p>
